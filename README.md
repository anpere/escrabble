Scrabble Piece Generator

## Piece Generation

Create a hamming code for letters in Spanish given the frequencies
at which they appear in the Spanish dictionary.

Assign pieces values based on the length of the code

The rarer the letter, the longer the code, the more points that piece is worth.

This all assumes that the rarer the letter the harder it is to use in a word.
